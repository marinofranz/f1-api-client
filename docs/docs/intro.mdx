import { InstallTabs } from "@site/src/components/InstallTabs"

# Introduction

This Node.js package allows you to use [Marino's F1 API](https://f1.marino.codes/docs) in Node.js without the hassle of manually taking care of the URL, and the return types. This package will always return typed responses.

## Installation

You can install `f1.ts` via any package manager that uses the `npm` registry.

<InstallTabs pkg="f1.ts" />

## Example usage

```ts
import { schedule } from "f1.ts"

const currentSchedule = await schedule.current()
const { roundNumber } = currentSchedule.round(1)
console.log(roundNumber) // output -> 1
```

## Contributions

You're free to make whatever contributions you can to the package. However, it is at my discretion whether to merge pull requests and I will close any PRs that do not benefit the package.

Any questions? Contact me via [email](mailto:me@marino.codes).
